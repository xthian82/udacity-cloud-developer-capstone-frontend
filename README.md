# Recipe Applicacion 

This sample uses the integration of [Auth0 React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) into a React

# Main idea
Basic crud for recipe from logged users

# Public content
posts created by logged users are available to search by non-logged users
the idea behing this is to be able when a user is logged to like recipess loaded by others users,
however... this like button is not implemented yet.

My lack of fully knowlege of front-end is the reason to complete all the full caps on time.

# improvements not tacled
better css
notifications on uploading, creating for logged user

# Docker 

this ui can be run by
```
docker run -d -it -p 3000:3000 xthian82/udacity-front-capstone:v0.0.1
```
